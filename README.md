To capture the evolution of the values of crypto-currencies in the cross-section, crix.hu-berlin.de offers an index which tracks the average price movement of the most representative altcoins, similar to a stock-market index. CRIX determines the coins included via an information criterion and weighs their return contributions by the respective amounts of coins at the start of each month. Thus, CRIX mimics a monthly rebalanced portfolio. While S&amp;P500 and the CSI300 provide a summary statistic about the current state of the US and Chinese markets, respectively, CRIX does the same for the crypto-currency market. CRIX was proposed by H ̈ardle and Trimborn (2015) and further investigated by Trimborn and H ̈ardle (2016). The first publication proposes a first version of CRIX and compares the dynamics of the index against other markets. The latter further develops the methodology of CRIX and evaluates the performance of the methodology on other markets.
